# Power-BI

In this repository we have Power BI files where we explore a wide variety of different techniques to analyse the data for different business tasks. This knowledge is then tested and concretised by exercises which are great for learning and practice. A novice learning Power BI, or an experienced individual who is coming back to Power BI after some time of not using it will also benefit from going through the material.
